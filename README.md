# **Reinforcement Learning**

Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning course repository.  
This repository contains all course-related work developed throughout the semester.

---

## **TASK 1**

Simulate a **Grid World** environment, including **reward dynamics** and **policy visualization**.  
Implement **policy iteration** and **value iteration** to find the optimal policy.  
Finally, implement the **Q-learning** algorithm.

All the tasks above are divided into **three notebooks**, where each notebook continues from the previous one.
